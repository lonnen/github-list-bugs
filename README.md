## Github List Bugs

A Firefox addon that will add a list of bugzilla links for all bugs mentioned
in the commit messages of a github compare view. It also includes a link to
open all of the bugs in tabs. I find it quite useful. I hope you do too.

It's not on AMO yet, so [download from Github](https://github.com/pmclanahan/github-list-bugs/raw/master/github-list-bugs.xpi) and install from Firefox.
